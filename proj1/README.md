# Project 1 - **Parallel and Distributed Computing**

## **Matrix Multiplication Performance Evaluation**

This repository contains code and documentation for a project focusing on evaluating matrix multiplication algorithms' performance. The project is split into two parts:

1. **Single Core Performance Evaluation**:
   - Implement matrix multiplication algorithms in different languages.
   - Measure processing time for various matrix sizes.
   - Explore element-wise and block-oriented algorithms.

2. **Multi-Core Implementation Analysis**:
   - Parallelize matrix multiplication using OpenMP.
   - Compare performance metrics such as MFlops, speedup, and efficiency.

*Note: PAPI was used for performance metrics, and the project assumes Linux native tools.*
